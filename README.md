Project Name: Desktop Assistant
Overview:
This project implements a desktop assistant, named Jarvis, that is controlled using voice commands. It utilizes various Python libraries to provide a range of functionalities, including text-to-speech conversion, speech recognition, and interaction with web services.

Key Features:
Voice Control: Users can issue commands to Jarvis using voice input.
Text-to-Speech: Jarvis is equipped with text-to-speech functionality, enabling it to respond audibly to user queries and commands.
Email Composition and Sending: Users can compose and send emails through Jarvis.
Music Playback: Jarvis can play music stored locally on the system.
Wikipedia Search: Users can ask Jarvis to search and summarize information from Wikipedia.
Web Browsing: Jarvis can open various websites, such as Google, YouTube, and Stack Overflow, in a web browser.
Code Editor Launch: Jarvis is capable of launching a code editor or IDE with a voice command.
Technologies Used:
Python: The core language used for development.
Pyttsx3: Python library for text-to-speech conversion.
SpeechRecognition: Library for speech recognition.
Wikipedia API: API for accessing Wikipedia content.
Webbrowser: Python module for web browsing functionality.
OS: Python module for interacting with the operating system.
SMTPLib: Python library for sending emails.
Others: Additional libraries and modules for specific functionalities.
How to Use:
Ensure all required Python packages are installed using pip.
Run the jarvis.py script.
Upon startup, Jarvis will greet the user and wait for voice commands.
Issue voice commands to Jarvis to perform various tasks as described above.
Future Improvements:
Natural Language Processing: Enhance Jarvis's understanding of natural language for more intuitive interactions.
Enhanced Web Search: Improve the accuracy and depth of web searches performed by Jarvis.
Personalization: Implement features for user profiles and preferences to tailor Jarvis's responses and actions.
Expanded Functionality: Integrate additional features and capabilities to make Jarvis even more useful.
